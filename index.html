    <p>Compared to most students, I consider myself very new to the field of Computer Science.
      I had picked up Computer Science as a <i>minor</i>, not a major, after being made to take a 
      required introductory Computer Science class for my Digital Innovation Television & Film (DIFT) major.
      Prior to this, my exposure to Computer Science dated nearly a decade ago. With shameful recollection,
      I had attempted to self-teach HTML to myself on a popular pet simulator site at the time, Neopets, in 
      order to introduce a custom flair to my pages there. However, I was met with error after error,  had no one 
      to turn to but a primitive "how-to" guide, and eventually assumed I could never be any good at Computer Science
      and gave up.</p>
    
    <p>So imagine my surprise when I don't fail this dreaded Computer Science class. This class, with an infamously 
    strict professor according to former classmates and fellow DIFT majors who appear to hate Computer Science classes
    in general. On the contrary, I excel. I think what caught my interest the most was the design of programs 
    and the experimenting with features I never used to think I could do. As such,  </p>
