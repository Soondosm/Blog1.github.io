    <h1>Of frogs and stone soups</h1>
    <p>Compared to most students, I consider myself very new to the field of Computer Science.
      I had picked up Computer Science as a <i>minor</i>, not a major, after being made to take a 
      required introductory Computer Science class for my Digital Innovation Television & Film (DIFT) major.
      Prior to this, my exposure to Computer Science dated nearly a decade ago. With shameful recollection,
      I had attempted to self-teach HTML to myself on a popular pet simulator site at the time, Neopets, in 
      order to introduce a custom flair to my pages there. However, I was met with error after error,  had no one 
      to turn to but a primitive "how-to" guide, and eventually assumed I could never be any good at Computer Science
      and gave up.</p>
    
    <p>So imagine my surprise </p>
