    <p>Compared to most students, I consider myself very new to the field of Computer Science.
      I had picked up Computer Science as a <i>minor</i>, not a major, after being made to take a 
      required introductory Computer Science class for my Digital Innovation Television & Film (DIFT) major.
      Prior to this, my exposure to Computer Science dated nearly a decade ago. With shameful recollection,
      I had attempted to self-teach HTML to myself on a popular pet simulator site at the time, Neopets, in 
      order to introduce a custom flair to my pages there. However, I was met with error after error,  had no one 
      to turn to but a primitive "how-to" guide, and eventually assumed I could never be any good at Computer Science
      and gave up.</p>

    <p>So imagine my surprise when I don't fail this dreaded Computer Science class. This class, with an infamously 
    strict professor according to former classmates and fellow DIFT majors who appear to hate Computer Science classes
    in general. On the contrary, I excel. I think what caught my interest the most was the design of programs 
    and the experimenting with features I never used to think I could do. As someone with an English major at the time 
    who had a particular passion for storytelling and weaving together things that could be shared with others,
    I appreciated the precision and modern applications of Computer Science. And apparently I appreciated it enough
  to want to finally turn my  minor into a major Spring semester of my junior year.</p>
    
    <p>I chose to speak on Section 2, Software Entropy from Chapter one of <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em>.
      This is not only due to my resonating with the window example, but because of my surprise at learning of 
      the increasing disorder of software leading to "software rot". Beginning with the window example--if a window is
      broken, then the outside can seep into the inside--what is housed and protected is suddenly exposed to the outdoors,
      like an open wound. Unfortunately, unlike human wounds, windows do not heal on their own--and unless there is
      intervention, further problems can occur down the line. While I recall from essentially all of my Computer Science
      courses that one should check their code frequently and thoroughly to detect errors early, I did not realize the 
      potential devastation that could be caused by allowing mistakes to go unsolved for too long. The firefighters example
      when putting out fires also fascinated me. "You don't want to be the first one to make a mess", I recall the section
      stating, and I can understand it. By being the first to make a mess, the programmer will be the first to cause a 
      problem--and problems slow down development. Overall, while I had a vague grasp of what to do in order to evade
      distaster, I did not quite understand the reasoning why--or the potential disasters that could be avoided--till
      I had the opportunity to read this chapter.</p>
